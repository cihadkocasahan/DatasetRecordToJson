# DatasetRecordToJson
The provided code defines a Delphi unit named TJSONLog that deals with converting data between a dataset (a structured collection of data, often linked to a database) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings. Here's an overview of how it works:
Class Definition: The TJSONLog class is defined, which contains two static methods for converting data between a dataset and a JSON string.

Variant to Field Mapping: The GetVariantTypeAsFieldType function is defined to map various variant types (a dynamic data type in Delphi) to specific field types used in datasets.

DataSetToJSONString Method: The DataSetToJSONString method takes a dataset (TDataSet) as input and converts its records into a JSON array of objects. Each field in a record is checked for null values, and if not null, the field name and its corresponding value are added to the JSON object.

JSONStringToDataSet Method: The JSONStringToDataSet method performs the reverse operation. It takes a JSON string as input, parses it to retrieve an array of objects, and then populates a dataset with the values from the JSON objects. Each field's value is assigned to the corresponding field in the dataset's records.

Destructor: The class destructor ensures proper disposal of resources.

Usage: The intended usage is to create instances of this class and call the DataSetToJSONString and JSONStringToDataSet methods as needed to convert data between datasets and JSON strings.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to convert data between a dataset and JSON format, which can be particularly useful for storing, transmitting, or synchronizing data in a structured yet flexible manner. It's important to note that this code is part of a larger system and is meant to be integrated into applications that utilize datasets and require JSON data interchange.
